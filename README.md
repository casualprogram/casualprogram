## Hello, my name is Thanh :dizzy:
As a sneaker head, I faced challenges purchasing my favorite pairs. To overcome this, by researched website functionality, I discovered a Shopify queue bypass, fetch early checkout link for SNKRS/Nike, try to find any faster method to checkout. My journey into sneaker bots in 2019 ignited my passion for using software solutions. I started with JavaScript, building a simple automated checkout software using NodeJS. Currently, I am learning on how to optimizing automation speed with HTTPS requests and expanding my skills in ReactJS/React Native for front-end development. My goal is to contribute to impactful software products, leveraging my technical skills and problem-solving mindset. Let's connect :smile: !
